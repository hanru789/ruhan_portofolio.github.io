    <h2>Bike Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. Through these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one position and return it at another. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world, which are composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental, and health issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from the interesting real-world applications of bike-sharing systems, the characteristics of the data being generated by these systems make them attractive for research. Unlike other transport services, such as buses or subways, the duration of travel, departure, and arrival positions are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns the bike-sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of the important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

    <h2>NFL Big Data Bowl 2025</h2>
    <p>
        The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have analyzed running backs, defensive backs, special teams, pass rush plays, and tackling, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a data science project using the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl competition dataset, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/data?select=games.csv">Kaggle</a>. This dataset has 13 CSV files that will be explored and analyzed one by one, and then a comprehensive analysis will be carried out on all the CSV files. You can access the analysis through the links below:
