## NFL-POSITIONING TRAINING ASISTANCE
This paper introduces a novel approach for evaluating NFL strategies through AI-driven simulation and analysis, emphasizing third-down scenarios and pre-snap data. By employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aims to predict the success of specific formations, providing coaches and players with real-time insights for tactical decision-making. The model primarily focuses on player positioning and formation evaluation, excluding other factors to enhance its applicability in strategy optimization.

This project conducts analysis and makes an interactive application of the CNN-Model. You can access the  this:

## NFL Big Data Bowl 2025
The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have analyzed running backs, defensive backs, special teams, pass rush plays, and tackling, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams.

This is a data science project using the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl competition dataset which can be downloaded at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/data?select=games.csv).
This dataset has 13 csv files that will be explored and analyzed one by one and then a comprehensive analysis will be carried out on all csv files. You can access the analysis through this:

## Bike Sharing
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

This project conducts analysis and makes an interactive dashboard of the analysis data. You can access the dataset, analysis, and dashboard through this:

## Student Study Result Prediction
This project was conducted to create a model that can predict the possibility of student learning outcomes at school. School is a place where students study intensively, so school success does not depend only on student activities during class hours. Based on research, it is known that breakfast has a significant effect on student concentration during class hours 1. In addition, student background, student activities outside the school schedule, and various other things certainly have their own correlations with students' school achievements.

This project needs to be done because the resulting model can predict how students can achieve their achievements at school. By knowing this, it is hoped that students and their families can evaluate and improve things that need to be improved so that student learning outcomes can increase.
